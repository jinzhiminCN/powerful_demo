# This code was initally taken from Tensorflow's PTB tutorial:
# https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/recurrent/
# In this tutorial we will show how to train a recurrent neural network on a challenging task
# of language modeling. The goal of the problem is to fit a probabilistic model which assigns
# probabilities to sentences. It does so by predicting next words in a text given a history
# of previous words. For this purpose we will use the Penn Tree Bank (PTB) dataset, which is
# a popular benchmark for measuring the quality of these models, whilst being small and relatively fast to train.
